# ‚úÖ GitHub Actions Automation - Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### ‚ùå Previous Issues:
1. **Wrong execution order** - RandomForest.py ran BEFORE FetchInjuryAndExternalNews.py
2. **Missing result updates** - update_prediction_results.py wasn't being called
3. **No overwrite protection** - Completed games could be re-predicted
4. **Incomplete commits** - prediction_history.json wasn't being committed

### ‚úÖ Current Implementation:

## 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/update_predictions.yml`

**Schedule:** Runs daily at 6:00 AM EST (11:00 AM UTC)

**Execution Order (CRITICAL):**
```
Step 1: FetchInjuryAndExternalNews.py
  ‚Üì Generates fresh injury data
Step 2: update_prediction_results.py
  ‚Üì Updates actual scores for completed games
Step 3: RandomForest.py
  ‚Üì Generates predictions for TOMORROW ONLY
Step 4: Git commit all CSV/JSON files
```

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Scripts run in correct dependency order
- ‚úÖ All required files committed (injuries.csv, prediction_history.json, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Better commit messages with timestamps
- ‚úÖ Added all missing Python dependencies (lxml, aiohttp)

---

## 2. Enhanced Prediction History Protection
**File:** `Models/prediction_history.py`

**Added Logic:**
```python
if existing and existing.completed:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping prediction update for completed game")
    return  # DO NOT overwrite completed predictions
```

**What This Does:**
- Once a game is marked `completed: true`, the prediction is **permanently locked**
- Actual scores, winners, and accuracy metrics are preserved forever
- Daily runs can only update future/pending predictions

---

## 3. Date Filtering in RandomForest.py
**Already Implemented (Verified):**

```python
current_date = date.today()
target_date = current_date + timedelta(days=1)

# Only predict games for tomorrow
if game_date < current_date:
    continue  # Skip past games
if target_date is not None and game_date != target_date:
    continue  # Skip all games except target date
```

**Result:**
- `prediction_results.csv` only contains tomorrow's games
- Past predictions are pruned from CSV
- Historical data preserved in `prediction_history.json`

---

## How It Works - Daily Cycle

### October 26, 2025 (Today) - 6:00 AM EST

**Step 1: Fetch Injuries**
```bash
cd Data_Gathering_&_Cleaning
python FetchInjuryAndExternalNews.py
```
- Scrapes ESPN injury reports
- Fetches player stats from NBA API
- Uses Groq AI to analyze news articles
- Outputs: `injuries.csv`, `individual_player_scores.csv`

**Step 2: Update Results**
```bash
cd Models
python update_prediction_results.py
```
- Fetches actual scores for Oct 21-25 games
- Marks predictions as `completed: true`
- Calculates accuracy metrics
- Updates: `prediction_history.json` only

**Step 3: Generate Predictions**
```bash
python RandomForest.py
```
- Loads fresh injury data from Step 1
- Trains RandomForest model on historical data
- **ONLY predicts October 27 games**
- Fetches ESPN predictions for comparison
- Outputs: `prediction_results.csv`, `win_loss_records.csv`, `prediction_history.json`

**Step 4: Commit Changes**
```bash
git add injuries.csv prediction_results.csv prediction_history.json ...
git commit -m "ü§ñ Daily Update: Predictions, Injuries & Results - 2025-10-26"
git push
```

## Data Integrity Guarantees

### ‚úÖ What Gets Updated Daily:
- Injury statuses (players change from Out ‚Üí Day-to-Day ‚Üí Active)
- Player impact scores (AI-adjusted based on news)
- Tomorrow's game predictions (fresh HSS calculations)
- Actual results for recently completed games

### üõ°Ô∏è What NEVER Gets Overwritten:
- Completed game predictions (locked with `completed: true`)
- Actual scores once recorded
- Historical accuracy metrics
- Original prediction timestamps (`generated_at`)

### üìä CSV Export Logic:
**`prediction_results.csv`**
- Only shows games scheduled for tomorrow
- Refreshed daily with latest injury adjustments
- Used by main predictions table on website

**`prediction_history.json`**
- Complete archive of ALL predictions
- Both pending and completed games
- Never deleted, only appended
- Used by analytics dashboard

## Verification Checklist

Run this script to verify automation is working:
```bash
python verify_automation.py
```

**Checks:**
- ‚úÖ prediction_history.json is valid JSON
- ‚úÖ Completed games have actual results
- ‚úÖ prediction_results.csv only has future games
- ‚úÖ No completed games appear in CSV
- ‚úÖ Injury data is fresh (<24 hours old)
- ‚úÖ Calculates overall prediction accuracy

---

## Manual Testing

### Test Full Pipeline Locally:
```powershell
# Run the complete automation sequence
.\start-backend.ps1

# Or run each step individually:
cd Data_Gathering_&_Cleaning
python FetchInjuryAndExternalNews.py
cd ..\Models
python update_prediction_results.py
python RandomForest.py
cd ..
```

### Verify GitHub Actions:
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Check latest "Update Predictions Daily" run
3. Verify all 4 steps completed successfully
4. Check commit history for automated commits

---

## Configuration Files

### `.github/workflows/update_predictions.yml`
- **Schedule:** `cron: "0 11 * * *"` (6 AM EST daily)
- **Secrets:** Requires `GROQ_API_KEY` in repository settings
- **Permissions:** `contents: write` for git push

### `Models/config.py`
```python
CURRENT_SEASON = "2025-26"
MODEL_VERSION = "rf-1.1.0"
```

---

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check GitHub Actions Logs:
```
Repository ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Latest workflow run
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Fetching current injuries and player impact scores"
- ‚úÖ "Updating actual game results for completed games"
- ‚úÖ "Generating predictions for upcoming games"
- ‚úÖ Git commit success message

### Common Issues:

**‚ùå No predictions generated**
- Check if there are games scheduled for tomorrow
- Verify schedule CSV files exist in `Schedule/{Team}/{Team}.csv`

**‚ùå Injury data not updating**
- Check GROQ_API_KEY secret is set
- Review FetchInjuryAndExternalNews.py logs for API errors

**‚ùå Old predictions still showing**
- Verify `target_date` filter is active in RandomForest.py
- Check `prune_before_date()` is being called

**‚ùå Completed games being re-predicted**
- Verify protection logic exists in prediction_history.py
- Check `completed: true` flag is being set properly
